# Calculate Stamp Duty Land Tax
This calculation is based on the rates of 2019.

For simplicity we are assuming:
- The buyer of the house currently owns a property and lives in it as their main residence
- The buyer does not conduct any kind of business activity from their house i.e. it is purely for personal use
- The buyer does not own any other properties
- At the end of the purchase the buyer will still only own one house i.e. they intent to sell their current home at the same date they buy the new one
